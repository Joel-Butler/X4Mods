# X4 Mod Mod-jbm-test

## Overview
This module is meant for dynamic experimentation as a testbed for further development.
So far all it does is add a new conversation option to all user initiated dialog and attempts to spit out some debug information.

## Suggested uses
1. Use the 'build.bat' script to deploy to your extensions folder, and leverage /refreshmd and/or /reloadui to instruct X4 to reload any changes.

## Planned areas of improvement
1. Reliable debug and logging output - need to get this working in a way that gets me the information required to test new scripts thoroughly. 
2. User feedback via UI or chat output.
3. Notes and annotations on areas of potential development/enhancements.

## Can I use this? 
This is a mod for [X4 Foundations](https://www.egosoft.com/games/x4/info_en.php),  You're welcome to leverage my code or what I've learned in your own tweaks and modifications to the X4 game, but you do so at your own risk. While I am careful to ensure that this mod only does what it should do, this is a side project and I cannot make any claims as to the security and stability of this release. Please make sure you inspect this set of resources carefully and take particular care in invoking any scripts or commands with elevated rights. 

If this *is* helpful or of value a mention of me and/or this repo would be greatly appreciated, but isn't required.

Happy modding!
